			<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I served in the United States Army as a Motor Transport Operator (88m) for 3 years and was honorably discharged as a rank of E-4/Specialist. After seperating from the Army I began attending college to pursue my goal of obtaining a bachelor's degree in Radiologic Technology. After attending college for several years my interests shifted towards computer programming and I bagan teaching myself the basics of web development and now I am a creative and highly skilled entry-level front end developer who recently graduated a rigorous 4 month front end developer bootcamp at Codeup in San Antonio, Texas.
